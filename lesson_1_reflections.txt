Lesson 1 showed that comparing 2 files can be a lengthy process if
undertaken manually. Automatic/computerised methods are faster but also
provide an almost 100% level of accuracy (not accounting for bugs/errors 
in the software)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can determin what worked and what didin't, and instead of trying to reverse
changes you can simply revert to the old version. It alos allows you to see
what you thinking was when writing a partivular line of code (though good 
commenting proctices should take care of that!)
